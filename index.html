        <h1>Hi! I'm Cookie</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my website! I was born in a barn, but now
            I live in a nice home in Boone, NC. I have a mom and dad, and a
            new cat brother named Pow Pow, and a new dog sister
            named Grizzle.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love treats, toys, and trying to escape outside.
            When I'm not busy playing or biting everything in
            sight, I also like snuggles. I purr real loud, and
            I'm working on my big cat ROAR. Mom says my meow
            is just a little squeak for now, but with hard work
            and practice it will become real loud.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mom and dad feed me and play with me everyday. They buy
            and make me new toys. They can't play as long or
            as hard as I can, but I am training them seven days a week
            to be great 'cathletes'. I like to eat right next to brother
            Pow Pow when it's time to refuel for more fun.

        </p>
